                        <p>Tucked away in a battleaxe lot on Darby Street, Covert House is designed for a multi-
                            generational family consisting of a couple, their son and his grandmother. The final design was
                            produced in consideration of the client’s brief, local development control plans and environmental
                            plans.</p>
                        <p>
                            As part of the brief, the couple intended to incorporate an art studio accessible to their clients. The
                            studio is situated at the entrance of the site, maintaining privacy for the remainder of their home. The
                            family’s aim to create a fluid relationship between their indoor and outdoor spaces. was achieved
                            through small courtyards of varying privacies dispersed throughout the house, in addition to a
                            cascading rooftop garden. Ageing-in-place elements were also incorporated for the grandmother’s
                            bedroom downstairs to accommodate easy access to amenities whilst also providing her with a
                            private courtyard.</p>
