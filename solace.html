                        <p>
                            Solace proposes an affordable housing solution to meet Newcastle’s growing population demands
                            whilst bridging its urban socioeconomic gaps. Situated on the former BHP Newcastle Steelworks
                            site, this ‘city within a city’ aims to provide equitable access to space, amenity and utility to encourage
                            an inclusive sense of community.</p>
                        <p>
                            The city offers diverse housing types modelled based on existing and forthcoming Newcastle tenant
                            pools. A total of 30 apartment blocks are located in the city, with each block housing 100 residents.
                            Civic and recreational spaces were introduced alongside land remediation strategies to reconfigure
                            the site as an accessible, mixed-use area. The city also features an integrated light rail system that
                            provides the local population access to a wide range of services within the city and the broader
                            Newcastle region.</p>
                        <p>
                            Branching beyond the site boundaries through purpose-built infrastructure, the city connects local
                            industries and communities with work and education opportunities. With the expected increase
                            of light industrial precincts near the site, the city holds great potential in providing housing and
                            workspaces in close proximity to industries along the port. Solace recognises connectivity as a key
                            aspect in sustaining a successful housing solution.</p>
