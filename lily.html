                        <p>Lily Pads explores parametric design through digital fabrication in Rhino and Grasshopper. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns, the Frog Pond at Foreshore Park, which had been drained and left to an unknown fate, was regularly used by Novocastrians in their one hour of restricted outdoor exercise as a makeshift skate park. The site was heavily exposed to the elements, prompting ourgroup to design an accessible shelters for users.</p>
                        <p>
                        Initial concepts that proposed for this project to resemble lily pads were developed in association with the original function of the site as a Frog Pond. The final design is a set of netted rings that provide resting platforms on the pond's surface. Bamboo lattice mimicking the underside of lily pads emerge through the rings to provide shade across three different areas of the site that had been organically zoned by its users.</p>
